# inclusify [![CI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/hashicorp/inclusify.svg?style=svg&circle-token=0ae7a4e49ff1f990f45536f92c62dab322f13113)](https://circleci.com/gh/hashicorp/inclusify/tree/master)

Inclusify is a CLI that will rename the default branch of any GitHub repo and perform all other necessary tasks that go along with it, such as updating CI references, updating the base branch of open PR's, copying the branch protection, and deleting the old base.

```
Usage: inclusify [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
    createBranches    Create new branches on GitHub. [subcommand]
    deleteBranches    Delete repo's base branch and other auto-created branches. [subcommand]
    updateRefs        Update code references from base to target in the given repo. [subcommand]
    updateDefault     Update repo's default branch. [subcommand]
    updatePulls       Update base branch of open PR's. [subcommand]
```

## Usage

1. Download the latest release for your os/platform from https://github.com/hashicorp/inclusify/releases, and unzip to access the go binary.

2. Create an `.env` file with the following variables:

| Environment Variable                   | Explanation                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| export INCLUSIFY_OWNER="$owner"        | REQUIRED: Name of the GitHub org or user account where the repo lives                |
| export INCLUSIFY_REPO="$repo"          | REQUIRED: Name of the repo to update                                                 |
| export INCLUSIFY_TOKEN="$github_token" | REQUIRED: GitHub personal access token with -rw permissions                          |
| export INCLUSIFY_BASE="master"         | OPTIONAL: Name of the current default branch for the repo. This defaults to "master" |
| export INCLUSIFY_TARGET="main"         | OPTIONAL: Name of the new target base branch for the repo. This defaults to "main"   |
| export INCLUSIFY_EXCLUSION="vendor/,scripts/hello.py,README.md" | OPTIONAL: Comma delimited list of directories or files to exclude from the find/replace. Paths should be relative to the root of the repo. |

**Note:** You can alternatively pass in the required flags to the subcommands or set environment variables locally without sourcing an env file. For ease of use, however, we recommend sourcing a local env file. 

3. Source the file to set the environment variables locally: `source .env` 

4. Run the below commands in the following order:

Set up the new target branch and temporary branches which will be used in the next steps, and create a PR to update all code references from `base` to `target`. This happens via a simple find and replace within all files in the repo, with the exception of `.git/`, `go.mod`, and `go.sum`. To exclude other directories or files from the search, add them to `INCLUSIFY_EXCLUSION`. 
```
./inclusify createBranches
./inclusify updateRefs
```

On success, updateRefs will return a pull request URL. **Review the PR carefully, make any required changes, and merge it into the `target` branch before continuing.** 

Continue with the below commands to update the base branch of any open PR's from `base` to `target`. Finally, update the repo's default branch from `base` to `target`. If the `base` branch was protected, copy that protection over to `target`. 
```
./inclusify updatePulls
./inclusify updateDefault
```

After verifying everything is working properly, delete the old base branch. If the `base` branch was protected, the protection will be removed automatically, and then the branch will be deleted. This will also delete the `update-references` branch that was created in the first step. 
```
./inclusify deleteBranches
```

5. Instruct all contributors to the repository to reset their local remote origins using one of the below methods:
    1. Reset your local repo and branches to point to the new default
        1. run `git fetch`
            1. fetches all upstream tags/branches; this will pull the new default branch and update that the previous one at `origin/$INCLUSIFY_BASE` has been deleted
        1. run `git remote set-head origin -a`
            1. this sets your local `origin/HEAD` to reflect the source `origin/HEAD` of the new default branch
        1. for each of your in-progress branches, run `git branch --set-upstream-to origin/$INCLUSIFY_TARGET`, e.g. `git branch --set-upstream-to origin/main`
            1. this sets your local branch(es) to track diffs from `origin/$INCLUSIFY_TARGET`
        1. the last step has two options:
            1. if you only have `$INCLUSIFY_BASE` e.g. `master` in your local list of branches, then you need to rename it to `$INCLUSIFY_TARGET` e.g. `main` by running `git branch -m master main`
            1. if you have both `master` and `main` branches in your list, then delete your local copy of `master` with `git branch -d master`
    1. Delete your local repo and reclone
        1. Of course you will want to push up any in-progress work first, ensure you don't have anything valuable stashed, etc.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/inclusify.git ~/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/inclusify
cd ~/go/src/github.com/hashicorp/inclusify
```

2. Make any modifications you wish, and build the go binary
```
go build -o inclusify ./cmd/inclusify
```

3. Pass in the required flags to the subcommands, set env vars, or source a local env file, as explained in step #2 above. Remember that the GitHub token chosen will need to be associated with a user with `write` access on the repo.

4. Set your `$GOPATH`
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

5. Run the subcommands in the correct order, as explained in step #4 above. 

## Testing

To run the unit tests locally, clone the repo and run `go test ./...` or `gotestsum ./...` in the root of the directory. To run the integration tests, set the environment variables as described in step #2 above and add `--tags=integation` to the test command. These tests will create a new repo under the authenticated user, provision the repo, and create/delete real resources within it. Finally, the test repo will be deleted. 

All tests are run in CI on every push, and run against a repo in the format `$user/inclusify-tests-$random`.

## Docker

The Dockerfile is located in `build/package/docker` and is available on the `hashicorpdev` dockerhub account. Build locally with the following command:

```
docker build -f build/package/docker/Dockerfile -t inclusify .
docker run inclusify
```
